# Tic Tac Toe

This website provides a simple game for two human players to play the classic game Tic Tac Toe. Tic Tac Toe is a turn-based game where players take it in turns to lay their game piece in a 3x3 grid with the aim of forming three-in-a-row. The match is won when a player can get three of their own game piece in a row, whether it be horizontally, vertically or diagonally. A match can be drawn if neither player achieves a three-in-a-row before all the areas of the grid have been filled. Then the game can be just restarted and enjoyed all over again!

This game shows the basic functions in HTML, CSS and JavaScript so can be interesting to look at from that perspective - if the game is not interesting enough!

## Features

### Navigation

The website is all focused onto one page so there are no links to any other pages.

There is a Heading Box at the top which displays the name of the game and also which player is playing.

In the middle of the page is the playing grid. Is is a 3x3 grid of squares that can be clicked on during the duration of the game. Player 1 will enter X's and Player 2 will enter O's.

There is a text information underneath the playing grid, I have called it the status bar. It shows who's current turn it is and also if the match has been won or drawn.

At the bottom is the Play Again button which will restart the game, clearing the grid of previous game information.
